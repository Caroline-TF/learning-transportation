Learning-transportation documents are are contained in the lessons. These lessons help the new users to quickly learn about the software DTALite
and walk them through different tools and processes to analyze a network.

These learning documents can be found in the lessons folder on the homepage of learning-transportation. Different lessons contained in the folder are;

Lesson 1 --> Learning Transportation Network Analysis
This lesson is divided into following three parts:

Lesson 1.1 --> Introduction with the West Jordan Network  
    
Link: https://github.com/xzhou99/learning-transportation/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson%201/Lesson%201.1

Learning Objectives:  
 
1. Understand how to view/edit network attributes in NeXTA and GIS.

2. Run a basic simulation, comparing two different scenarios.

3. Understand how basic network attributes affect traffic simulation results.

2. Identify bottlenecks and model congestion propagation 

3. Calculate traffic states through different computational approaches.


Lesson 3 --> Network Modeling
This lesson is further divided into following two parts:

Lesson 3.1 --> Understand Network Equilibrium Model: Braess' Paradox.

Link: https://github.com/xzhou99/learning-transportation/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson%203/Lesson%203.1

Learning Objectives:

1. How to create a network by importing an Excel file in NeXTA

2. Understand modeling principles of user equilibrium

3. Know how to setup BPR function parameters for special link types

4. Understand the impact of adding a link and analyze the performance at link, path and network levels
 
5. The impact of different levels of demand on Braess’ paradox

6. Understand the impact of road pricing on Braess paradox and how to resolve Braess’ Paradox


Lesson 3.2 --> Route Choice Behavior: Modeling Considering Traveler Information Provision.

Link: https://github.com/xzhou99/learning-transportation/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson%203/Lesson%203.2

Learning Objectives:

1. Understand how different types/sources of travel time information are used in the route choice process in DTALite

2. Understand how to change incident, VMS, and travel time information settings in DTALite

3. Understand how to evaluate the route choice effects of VMS & traveler information in NeXTA


The other lessons will soon be added.
